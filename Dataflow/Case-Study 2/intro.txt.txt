Use Case: E-commerce Transaction Processing


Scenario: 

	You have sales transactions coming in from an e-commerce platform. Each transaction has fields like transaction_id, user_id, product_id, quantity, price, and timestamp. The data is stored in a CSV format in a GCS bucket. 
	
The task is to:

		a. Read the data.
		b. Validate each transaction (e.g., check if user_id, product_id, quantity, price are valid).
		c. Log and handle invalid transactions.
		d. Calculate total sales for each valid transaction.
		e. Write valid and transformed data to a BigQuery Table
		f. Write in-valid records to another GCS bucket
		g. Monitor the pipeline with basic metrics.
